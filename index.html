              Eduardo is extremely knowledgeable and skilled in his craft. As the Product Owner on our fairly complex
              project, I found that he is able to quickly understand the problem we are trying to solve and asks
              thoughtful, detailed questions to ensure that the best solution is implemented.

              Ed is extremely detail-oriented and meticulous with his code. He is also a wonderful team player, always
              willing to step up and assist a junior developer or pair to get someone unstuck. He has great
              communication skills for all levels of the business, whether it is with someone technical like himself,
              someone middle-ground like me, or someone not very technical like the client. He is always able to explain

              In addition to being a good developer, Eduardo has a great personality that makes him a great teammate. He
              was also committed to the success of the business, made sure everybody was feeling awesome (he took very
              good care of us when we visited in Argentina) and was a positive contributor at all times.

              Eduardo is one of the greatest person I'd had the pleasure to work with, He's professional, great partner
              and versatile. He is one of those people which you can give him an unknown problem and he will eventually
              find an optimal and efficient solution to it. Also he performs well communication ideas and arguing about
              them with the team.
